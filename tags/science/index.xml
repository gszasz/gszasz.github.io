We shouldn&amp;rsquo;t insist on using the right words, while the context is self-evident to everybody. The problem arises when people swap similar words with entirely different meaning, like in the following examples.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>astronomy – astrology&lt;/em>,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>physicist – physician&lt;/em>,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>meteorology – metrology&lt;/em>,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>scientometry – Scientology&lt;/em>,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>psychologist – psychopath&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This can lead to confusion and chain of misunderstandings. While words themselves do not matter, they should remain stable and well-defined for the sake of communication.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Media share information with the extensive amount of people. Swapping of the similar words in the media can lead to mass confusion. It&amp;rsquo;s surely not hard to imagine that saying, e.g., &lt;em>psychopath&lt;/em> instead of &lt;em>psychologist&lt;/em>, or &lt;em>Scientologist&lt;/em> instead of &lt;em>scientometrist&lt;/em> could have very unpleasant consequences. One would expect that media put extensive effort to get the terminology right, but it turns out it&amp;rsquo;s not the case.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The general public is aware that the Earth is being exposed to the collisions with interplanetary medium. An even small possibility of such a collision results in large headlines in the media. Unfortunately, media severely fail very when it comes to astronomy terms. It&amp;rsquo;s mind-blowing to realize that someone who is capable of learning the difference between &lt;em>physicist&lt;/em> and &lt;em>physician&lt;/em> is still able to mess up meteoroid with meteor or meteorite&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Meteoroid is a small piece of debris flying in space.&lt;/em> It&amp;rsquo;s usually a grain of sand or dust. The largest meteoroids have 1 meter in diameter. Everything from 1 meter to hundreds of kilometres in diameter is already being called asteroid.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Meteor&lt;/em> is a &lt;em>phenomenon&lt;/em> observed when a physical body from outer space is flying through Earth&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere in high velocity. The light is emitted by tube of excited and ionized air along the trajectory. Vast majority of meteors are caused by meteoroids or asteroids; nevertheless, it could be also any piece of artificial space debris. Meteors are also being commonly called &lt;em>shooting stars&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Meteorite&lt;/em> is &lt;em>a piece of rock found on the Earth&amp;rsquo;s surface&lt;/em> that happens to be the fragment of a meteoroid or an asteroid. As this fragment survived passage through the atmosphere, meteorite&amp;rsquo;s structure differs from the original material.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>These three terms are like an &lt;em>employer&lt;/em>, &lt;em>employment&lt;/em>, and &lt;em>employee&lt;/em> – although they are very similar and undoubtedly related words, they are &lt;em>not&lt;/em> mutually interchangeable.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
