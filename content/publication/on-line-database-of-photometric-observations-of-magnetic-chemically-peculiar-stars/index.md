abstract: "We present our extensive project of the On-line database of photometric observations of magnetic CP stars to collect published data of photometric observations of magnetic chemically peculiar (mCP) stars in the optical and near IR regions. The nascent database that contains now more than 107 thousand photometric measurements of the most important 102 mCP stars will be continuously supplemented with published or new photometric data on these and about 150 additional mCP stars. This poster describes the structure and organization of the database."
